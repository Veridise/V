The [V] Specification Language
==============================

[V] is a specification language for communicating tests/properties to the Veridise infrastructure. It is a language independent specification language capable of expressing complex properties while maintaining readability. 

Getting Started
===============
[V] consists of a series of sections that are organized into a structure called a specification. Most sections are made up of :doc:`[V] Statements<statements>` that specify a test or property. The following sections can be used in a specification:
 * `Variables <>`_
 * `Initializer <>`_ 
 * `Test <>`_ 
 * `Pre/Post Conditions <>`_ 
 * `Temporal Properties <>`_ 

Specifications
==============
[V] supports several different types of specifications that can be used to perform different tasks. Currently we support the following types of specifications:
 * `Behavioral Specifications <>`_ 
 * `Pre/Post Conditions<>`_
 * `Temporal Specifications<>`_

 Tools
 =====
 A number of tools either require a [V] specification as an input, or produce a [V] specification as an output. Below is a list of tools that interact with the [V] specification language:
