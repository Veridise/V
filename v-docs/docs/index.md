# Welcome to [V]! 

[V] is a declarative specification language for communicating tests/properties with the Veridise infrastructure. It provides a language- and blockchain-agnostic method of specifying properties about smart contracts.

## Getting Started

As a starting point, it is first useful to understand [V]â€™s building blocks. To do so, we would recommend that new users start with the following pages:

* [Execution Model](execution_model.md)
* [[V] Statements](statements.md)
* [Specification Variables and Macros](vars_and_macros.md)

## Specifications
[V] supports several different types of specifications that can be used to perform different tasks. Currently we support the following types of specifications:

* [Behavioral Specifications](behavioral_specs.md)
* [Temporal Specifications](temporal_specs.md)

## Tools

A number of tools either require a [V] specification as an input, or produce a [V] specification as an output. Below is a list of tools that interact with the [V] specification language:

* Eurus
* Medjai
* OrCa
